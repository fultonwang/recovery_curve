Overview: This directory contains the code to fit recovery curve models (in the recovery_curve subdirectory) as well as an simulated dataset(in the data subdirectory) and an example script(test_script) that shows how to fit a recovery model, generate posterior predictive predictions, and plot those predictions.  The example script is hardcoded to read data from the data subdirectory, and outputs plots of the posterior predictive distributions to the predictions subdirectory, which should be created after it is run (using the command "python test_script.py"

Setup: This directory should be added to the PYTHONPATH environment variable.  The code requires matplotlib, pandas, and pystan libraries.

Data format: The data used to fit a recovery curve model is split between 4 files.  Please see the 4 files in the data subdirectory for an example.  The pre-treatment values is stored in a file with N lines and one number per line, where N is the number of patients in the dataset.  The features are stored in a csv file with N lines.  The times at which observations of function values are available is stored in a file with N lines.  If the n-th patient has function values recorded at t times, then the n-th line of that file will contain t times, separated by commas.  Similarly, the actual function values are stored in a file with the exact same format, except the times are replaced by the function values at those times.
